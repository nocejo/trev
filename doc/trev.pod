=head1 NAME

trev.pl - taskwarrior tasks reviewing script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perl trev.pl [++mark] [start+] [filter]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

trev is sort of a mini-shell focusing on taskwarrior reviewing.

This script reads a list of pending taskwarrior (http://taskwarrior.org/) tasks and presents them to the user one at a time, prompting for an action --among a restricted set of taskwarrior commands; this action (or none) is performed on the task, whereupon the script proceeds to the next task up to the end of the list.

At the script prompt the user can also include the current into a set of marked tasks which is continuously shown.  Tasks into this set are marked by taskwarrior as active or with a certain tag chosen by the user.

Tasks list comes from a system call to task, obeying then the user preferred settings for visibility, order, decoration...

=head1 OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS

Command line structure: after the script name a number of option/argument (e.g.: -T 'Make these calls!') can follow; then two optional arguments (see below) can follow, ++mark and start+, in this order; and finally, an optional filter argument closes the invocation.  Order is mandatory. 

No options/arguments are required.  Options to set additional text in upper and/or lower labels con be issued. Optional arguments can be issued to set a marking tag, a task number for the review to start and/or a taskwarrior filter.  Order is mandatory (see below).

=head2 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

=item -T 'Additional text'

Adds 'Additional text' to the upper label, after 'Selected (mark): ', as a reminder or explanation.  Quotation marks are required if text contains blank spaces.

=item -t 'Additional text'

Adds 'Additional text' to the upper label, after 'Reviewing filter (n/m): ', as a reminder or explanation.  Quotation marks are required if text contains blank spaces..

=head2 ARGUMENTS

=over

=item [++mark]

If first argument starts with '++', as in 'trev.pl ++mark', the marking tag will be set to '+mark', marking action to 'modify +mark' and unmarking action to 'modify -mark'.  Double '+' is required in order to distinguish from a regular tag intended to be used as a filter.  If not set, default marking attribute is 'active', marking action is 'start' and unmarking action is 'stop' ('active' is not a taskwarrior tag but a report; this is not the more general case, which is intended to use a tag + modify).

=item [start+]

A numeric argument ending in '+' as in 'trev.pl 113+' , following an optional '++mark' and preceding any filter, requests the script to start reviewing at task number 113, and proceed to the end of the list.  This can be useful when resuming an interrupted long review.  Final '+' is required in order to distinguish from a just-one-task filter, like in 'trev.pl 113'.

=item [filter]

The rest of the line is taken as a taskwarrior filter --task number(s), report name, tag, bare term... see EXAMPLES below.  May be not all filters can be correctly interpreted.

=back

Argument/option order is mandatory: option(s) must come first, if at all issued. If a marking tag is specified it must be issued as the first argument following options; starting task number can be first (if no marking tag) or second (first is marking tag) after options.  Filter must go at the end of the line.

=head3 EXAMPLES

See EXAMPLES below

=head2 OPTIONS AT THE SCRIPT PROMPT

After displaying a progress bar, marked tasks and the current task, the script prompts for an action.  At this prompt you can issue this actions (entering them with [RET]):

=over 8

=item [RET]

[RETURN] or void line.  No action.  Proceeds to the next task.

=item b

Goes back to the previous task.

=item +

Marks task as 'active' (start-ing it, default) or with the requested marking tag.

=item -

Unmarks current task and take it out of the 'marked' set.

=item -n

If '-' is followed by a number, as in '-156', unmarks the referred task number, not to current.

=item action [args]

Executes a task action, Where allowed actions are: add, annotate, append, calendar, delete, denotate, done, duplicate, edit, information, log, modify, prepend, start, stop, undo and version.  Those that need a task number operate on the current task.  Can be shortened when not ambiguous.   Any action to perform on other task like in '175 delete' is not allowed.

=item q, quit, exit, bye

Terminate script execution.

=back


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Taskwarrior 2.2.0+ must be installed.

Some needed modules ship with perl (as of 5.06): Term::ANSIColor and Term::ReadLine .  But some do not:

=over 4

=item Term::ReadLine::Gnu

Perl extension for the GNU Readline/History Library.

=back

You will need to install it from your distribution (this is libterm-readline-gnu-perl.deb package in debian-like) or get it from CPAN.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Defaults (mark and marking actions, prompt text, label and separator styles) can be modified directly in the Configuration section of the script source code.  Perl is an interpreted scripting language, so no compilation or building is needed.

Currently you can choose between two localizations: en-US and es-ES.  This is done in the L10N section of the source code, uncommenting the localized STRINGs in your preferred localization and commenting out the other set.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item trev.pl

Reviews all visible tasks (user default filter), starts reviewing at first of them (default), mark/unmark current task with start/stop (default).

=item trev.pl ++week

Set marking tag to +week and mark/unmark current task with 'modify +week'/'modify -week'.

=item trev.pl ++calendula +ate_loops

Mark/unmark using 'modify +/-calendula'; Reviews only ate_loops tagged tasks.

=item trev.pl ++deleg 113+ pro:wp5

Set marking tag to +deleg, start reviewing at task 113 and process only tasks appertaining to a certain wp5 project.

=item trev.pl 113+ due:

Processes only tasks without a due date.  Start at task 113.  Mark/unmark with start/stop and starts at the top of the list (defaults).

=item trev.pl ++NOW overdue

Processes overdue tasks.  Mark/unmark with 'modify +/-NOW'.

=item trev.pl 113

Reviews just task 113.  Start/stop for mark/unmark (default).

=item trev.pl amsterdam

Review every task containing amsterdam in its description, starting at the top of the list and marking/unmarking with start/stop.

=item trev -T 'Make these phone calls\!' -t 'These are high-urgency actionable tasks!' ++call  urgency.over:12 +READY

Review every task with an urgency.over:12 and marked +READY, starting at the top of the list and marking/unmarking with mod +call/-call.  'Make these phone calls!' and 'These are high-urgency actionable tasks!' appear respectively at the end of upper and lower labels.  Remark the necessary escaping quotation marks.


=back


=head1 FILES

No specific files are used, but the script issues system calls to 'task', and this is the expected name of the task executable. This can be modified inside the source code.

=head1 CAVEATS

This is a slow script, specially when --after an action-- the order or number of tasks changes and next task must be located through its uuid.

In principle the script is intended to be used off-line, but if orders can come in any form from the web, beware: system calls are issued through backticks and any security check is performed.

=head1 BUGS

Probably.
